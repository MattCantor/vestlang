# Vestlang

> **A domain-specific language (DSL) for modeling vesting schedules**

Vestlang is a work-in-progress DSL designed to describe complex equity vesting schedules in a human-readable, composable format.

It provides two interopable representations:

- **Declarative Programs** - human- and machine-readable descriptions of vesting logic.
- **Imperative Vesting Installment Series** - normalized arrays of vesting installments with explicit triggers.

This dual design allows producers to emit simple arrrays of vesting dates and amounts, while advanced producers can describe arbitrary composite schedules that compile into those arrays.
