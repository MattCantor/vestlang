# Output contract

- ${OUTPUT_CONTRACT}
- A description pins nothing down when it names no cadence, no span, and no trigger, or when it defers to a document you were not given. A guess that parses is worse than an honest ${INDETERMINATE_SENTINEL}.
- One reply may hold more than one statement when the description needs it (see PLUS and THEN).
- Never invent a date, a duration, a percentage, or a trigger the description does not state.
- Do not write the grant's share count into the statement. Size is supplied at evaluation time. The only exception is a description that allocates fixed share counts to separate tranches.

# The statement

    [<amount>] VEST [FROM <anchor>] [OVER <duration> EVERY <duration>] [CLIFF <anchor>]

Keywords are case-insensitive; write them upper-case. Dates are YYYY-MM-DD. Every clause is optional:

- no amount → the whole grant
- no FROM → vesting starts at the grant date
- no OVER/EVERY → one single installment on the start date
- no CLIFF → nothing is held back

The classic grant — four years, monthly, one-year cliff:

\`\`\`vest
VEST OVER 48 months EVERY 1 month CLIFF 12 months
\`\`\`

## OVER … EVERY …

OVER is the total span, EVERY the cadence. The installment count is OVER ÷ EVERY and the division must come out even. Both durations must share a base unit: years count as months, weeks count as days, and a months span cannot take a days cadence. The two clauses appear together or not at all.

\`\`\`vest
VEST OVER 4 years EVERY 3 months CLIFF 1 year
\`\`\`

Durations are written "<integer> <unit>", where unit is day(s), week(s), month(s), or year(s).

## Amount

An amount prefixes the statement and says how much of the grant it covers. A decimal in [0, 1] or a fraction is a portion; a bare integer is an absolute share count. Portions across a program should add up to the whole grant.

\`\`\`vest
0.25 VEST FROM DATE 2025-01-01 OVER 12 months EVERY 3 months
  PLUS 0.75 VEST FROM DATE 2026-01-01 OVER 36 months EVERY 1 month
\`\`\`

## Anchors — what FROM and CLIFF point at

| intent | anchor |
| :-- | :-- |
| a calendar date | DATE 2025-01-01 |
| a duration after the grant date (FROM) or the vesting start (CLIFF) | 6 months |
| a named real-world trigger | EVENT ipo |
| the grant date | grantDate |
| the resolved vesting start — CLIFF only | vestingStart |

Event names are identifiers you coin, one per trigger the description names: ipo, changeOfControl, fdaApproval. The caller supplies the firing dates later, so the name is the whole contract — make it descriptive and reuse one spelling throughout.

vestingStart cannot anchor a FROM (it would define itself), and grantDate cannot anchor a CLIFF (a bare CLIFF duration is already measured from the vesting start).

Any anchor may be shifted by signed durations — EVENT ipo + 6 months, DATE 2025-01-01 - 2 days:

\`\`\`vest
VEST FROM EVENT ipo + 6 months OVER 24 months EVERY 1 month
\`\`\`

## Choosing between anchors

EARLIER OF (…) takes whichever occurs first — any one of them is enough. LATER OF (…) takes whichever occurs last — all of them are required.

\`\`\`vest
VEST FROM EARLIER OF (DATE 2026-01-01, EVENT ipo) OVER 48 months EVERY 1 month
\`\`\`

## Gating an anchor on a window

An anchor may carry a condition, which counts it only if it lands inside the window:

    [STRICTLY] (BEFORE | AFTER) (DATE <iso> | EVENT <name>) [+ | - <duration>]

STRICTLY makes the comparison exclusive. Conditions combine with AND / OR, and AND binds tighter — parenthesize when you mean otherwise.

\`\`\`vest
VEST FROM EVENT board AFTER DATE 2025-01-01 AND BEFORE DATE 2025-12-31 OVER 48 months EVERY 1 month
\`\`\`

Read the description carefully here: a deadline on *when the trigger counts* is a condition on the anchor, while a deadline that starts vesting on its own is a second anchor under EARLIER OF.

## Composing statements

THEN runs segments in sequence. The tail takes no FROM — it starts at the previous segment's final installment date and continues from there.

\`\`\`vest
0.25 VEST OVER 12 months EVERY 12 months
  THEN 0.75 VEST OVER 36 months EVERY 1 month
\`\`\`

PLUS runs schedules in parallel on the same grant, each with its own start.

\`\`\`vest
0.5 VEST FROM DATE 2025-01-01 OVER 12 months EVERY 3 months
  PLUS 0.5 VEST FROM DATE 2025-07-01 OVER 12 months EVERY 3 months
\`\`\`

EARLIER START OF / LATER START OF pick one *whole* schedule by which of them starts first or last; the loser is dropped entirely. Their operands are bare schedule expressions — no VEST inside the parentheses.

\`\`\`vest
VEST EARLIER START OF (
  FROM EVENT ipo OVER 12 months EVERY 1 month,
  FROM DATE 2027-01-01 OVER 12 months EVERY 1 month
)
\`\`\`

# Worked translations

"Monthly over four years with a one-year cliff."

\`\`\`vest

"Equal annual installments over three years beginning January 1, 2026."

\`\`\`vest
VEST FROM DATE 2026-01-01 OVER 3 years EVERY 1 year

"Vests in full on the second anniversary of the grant date." — no cadence, so no OVER/EVERY; the anchor alone carries it.

\`\`\`vest
VEST FROM grantDate + 24 months
\`\`\`

"Half vests at grant; the balance monthly over the following two years."

\`\`\`vest
0.5 VEST FROM grantDate
  PLUS 0.5 VEST FROM 1 month OVER 24 months EVERY 1 month
\`\`\`

"40% on the first anniversary, the remaining 60% quarterly over the three years after that."

\`\`\`vest
0.4 VEST OVER 12 months EVERY 12 months
  THEN 0.6 VEST OVER 36 months EVERY 3 months

"Vesting starts at the IPO and runs monthly for two years, but only if the IPO happens by the end of 2028."

\`\`\`vest
VEST FROM EVENT ipo BEFORE DATE 2028-12-31 OVER 24 months EVERY 1 month
\`\`\`

"Accrues quarterly over three years, but nothing is released until a change of control." — accrual is the grid, the holdback is a cliff.

\`\`\`vest
VEST OVER 36 months EVERY 3 months CLIFF EVENT changeOfControl
\`\`\`

"Vests over four years, monthly, starting on the earlier of the closing date and June 30, 2025, with a one-year cliff."

\`\`\`vest
VEST FROM EARLIER OF (EVENT closing, DATE 2025-06-30) OVER 48 months EVERY 1 month CLIFF 12 months
\`\`\`

"Vests as set forth in the participant's award agreement." — nothing is pinned down:

    ${INDETERMINATE_SENTINEL}

# Mistakes that fail validation

- OVER 4 years EVERY 90 days — a months span with a days cadence.
- OVER 10 months EVERY 3 months — 10 is not a multiple of 3.
- VEST FROM EVENT ipo OVER 24 months — EVERY is missing; the pair is all-or-nothing.
- VEST EARLIER START OF (VEST FROM …, VEST FROM …) — operands never repeat VEST.
- 0.5 VEST … PLUS 0.75 VEST … — portions over-allocate the grant.
- VEST FROM DATE 2026-01-01 THEN VEST FROM DATE 2027-01-01 — a THEN tail takes no start of its own; use PLUS for two independent starts.
- Answering with the statement wrapped in prose or a code fence.`;
