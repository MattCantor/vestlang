# Vestlang

> **A domain-specific language for modeling equity vesting schedules — and a canonical engine that resolves them exactly.**

[Documentation](https://mattcantor.github.io/vestlang/)

---

Every cap-table system models vesting a little differently, and the hardest part — the
*contingent* bits, like vesting that waits on an IPO or starts at the *later of* a date and
an event — usually can't be written down at all until the event happens. Vestlang tackles
both halves:

- **A DSL** for *writing* vesting intent, contingency included — **combinators** like
  `LATER OF` / `EARLIER OF`, event gates, and conditional starts (a combinator is an
  operator over anchors, e.g. "the later of 12 months and `EVENT "ipo"`").
- **A canonical engine** (`@vestlang/core`) that *resolves* that intent against runtime
  (the grant date, share count, which events have fired) and allocates exact integer shares.

The engine's template is a proposed **interchange** — a single, exact schedule format that
different cap-table tools can produce and consume, deliberately shaped to track Carta's
production cap-table schema. The DSL is where the contingency that an interchange *can't*
hold gets expressed and then resolved down to it.

```ts
import { parse, normalizeProgram, evaluateStatement } from "@vestlang/vestlang";

const program = normalizeProgram(parse("VEST OVER 4 years EVERY 1 month CLIFF 1 year"));
const schedule = evaluateStatement(program[0], {
  events: { grantDate: "2025-01-01" },
  grantQuantity: 4800,
  asOf: "2026-04-16",
});
// → 1,200 shares vest at the 1-year cliff (2026-01-01), then 100/month for 36 months.
//   37 installments that telescope exactly to 4,800 (the rounded shares sum to the
//   grant with no drift).
```

---

## How it works

The pipeline turns a DSL string into a classified, exactly-allocated schedule:

```
DSL string ──parse──▶ raw AST ──normalizeProgram──▶ Program (rich AST)
                                   │
                 resolve combinators vs. runtime, then CLASSIFY
                                   ▼
                          EvaluatedSchedule — two verdicts side by side:
                            storable     — what a record keeper can STORE
                                           (firing-invariant; safe to persist)
                            resolvesTo   — what it RESOLVES TO, given known events
                          + absenceAssumptions, findings, installments, blockers
```

### Two layers: *resolve* vs. *substitute*

The codebase splits along one precise line:

- **The engine (`@vestlang/core`) *substitutes*.** Given a fixed, combinator-free template
  + runtime + share count, it plugs in the values and allocates exactly — deterministically,
  one template + runtime → one installment set. It never sees a combinator, a symbolic date,
  or an "unresolved" state. This is the canonical interchange: exact-rational math, a
  time-based cliff, structural validation.
- **The front-end (`@vestlang/evaluator`, the "extended" layer) *resolves*.** Combinators
  let runtime *select the structure itself* — `LATER OF (12mo, EVENT "ipo")` becomes a
  different schedule depending on which date wins. The resolver evaluates that against
  runtime and then **classifies** the result into two verdicts side by side — what's
  storable (firing-invariant) and what it resolves to given the events known.

Think of it like a source language and an IR: the DSL expresses *contingency and intent*
that the resolved interchange can't *hold*; the engine is the exact, validated target that
multiple producers can share.

### Two classifications

Every evaluated schedule comes back with **two verdicts**, because "what can a record
keeper *store* for this" and "what does it *resolve to* right now" are different questions:

- **`storable`** — computed *without reading firings*, so a
  later event can never change it. Values: `template`, `events-only`, `unrepresentable`
  (no storable form even as bare events — a cross-unit deferred cliff, or a `THEN` tail
  behind an unfired start; an event-anchored cliff is *not* one of these — it stores as a
  `template`), `impossible` (a structural contradiction).
- **`resolvesTo`** — what it works out to, given the events currently known.
  Values: `template`, `events-only`, `unresolved` (pending on an unfired event),
  `impossible`.

They can differ for one schedule: a gated start `FROM DATE 2025-01-01 BEFORE EVENT "ipo"`
is a storable `template`, but if `ipo` is already on record *before* that date it resolves
to `impossible`. The flattened consumer view derives three reads — `representable` (from
storable), `pending` (from blockers; a `template` can be pending), `valid` (allocation ≤
grant) — so read each from its own flag, never from a `status`. Each installment also
carries its own `state` of `RESOLVED`, `UNRESOLVED`, or `IMPOSSIBLE`.

A schedule also discloses its **absence assumptions** — the events the resolves-to reading
is taking to be absent (each `{ eventId, through }`) — so a later or backdated firing that
would change the answer is surfaced, not silent. (A `BEFORE`/`AFTER` proviso against an
unfired event is *pending*, never silently satisfied or impossible — it could still be
recorded later. `impossible` is reserved for structural contradictions, like a date forced
before a strictly earlier one.)

**Template recovery.** `events-only` is a verdict about *authored structure*, not the
realized numbers — and some events-only programs project a stream that *does* have a
single-template form (two overlapping absolute-date grids that are really one cadence, say).
The default program evaluation — `evaluateProgramWithRecovery`, the MCP
`vestlang_evaluate` tool, and `vest evaluate` — re-infers that template and,
when it reproduces the projection exactly, publishes `template` with a `recovered` note, turning
a lossy `events-only` back into a clean canonical form. The rescue is sound only for
firing-invariant programs (no event anchors), so contingent schedules are never collapsed; the
raw, recovery-free classification still reports the structural verdict.

## Packages

Two packages are **published**; the rest are internal building blocks, inlined into the
umbrella at build time and never published on their own.

| Package | Published | Role |
|---|:---:|---|
| **`@vestlang/vestlang`** | ✅ | The umbrella toolkit — parse, normalize, evaluate, lint, stringify, infer. The package you install. |
| **`@vestlang/core`** | ✅ | The standalone reference compiler (dual CJS/ESM): a resolved, combinator-free template + a per-grant runtime → exact integer installments, with structural + runtime validation. Consumable on its own. |
| `@vestlang/primitives` | — | The shared engine substrate core sits on: exact-rational allocator, policy-aware date math, the grid kernel + time-based cliff, the anchor-date fold, the static empty-window analysis, the installment cap |
| `@vestlang/dsl` | — | PEG grammar + parser |
| `@vestlang/normalizer` | — | Raw AST → normalized canonical AST |
| `@vestlang/evaluator` | — | The resolver/classifier (the "extended" layer) |
| `@vestlang/inferrer` | — | The inverse: observed tranches → best-fit DSL (analytic hypothesize-and-verify) |
| `@vestlang/recover` | — | Template recovery: composes evaluator + inferrer to rescue an `events-only` program into a template when its projection has one |
| `@vestlang/pipeline` | — | The shared consumer layer both apps route through — parse → context → evaluate → view, behind one structured error model |
| `@vestlang/linter` · `@vestlang/stringify` · `@vestlang/types` | — | Diagnostics · DSL rendering · shared types |

Apps (private): `apps/cli`, `apps/mcp-server`, `apps/docs`. Both the CLI and the MCP
server orchestrate the engine through `@vestlang/pipeline` rather than wiring the
parse → evaluate → present steps themselves, so the two can't drift.

> The umbrella is published as `@vestlang/vestlang` today; the unscoped `vestlang` name is
> the intended target (pending a registry clearance).

## Using it

### 1. As a library

```bash
npm install @vestlang/vestlang      # or: pnpm add @vestlang/vestlang
```

```ts
import { parse, normalizeProgram, evaluateStatement } from "@vestlang/vestlang";

const program = normalizeProgram(parse('VEST OVER 4 years EVERY 1 month CLIFF 1 year'));
const schedule = evaluateStatement(program[0], {
  grantDate: "2025-01-01",     // the grant-date anchor (its own field)
  events: {},                  // named events the DSL references, e.g. { ipo: "2027-06-01" }
  grantQuantity: 4800,
  asOf: "2026-04-16",          // the scenario clock (required)
  // optional: vesting_day_of_month
});

schedule.storable.status;       // storable:    "template" | "events-only" | "unrepresentable" | "impossible"
schedule.resolvesTo.status;        // resolves-to: "template" | "events-only" | "unresolved" | "impossible"
schedule.resolvesTo.installments;  // [{ amount, date, meta: { state } }, ...]
schedule.absenceAssumptions;       // [{ eventId, through }, ...] — events assumed not yet fired
```

`toScheduleView(schedule)` flattens this into the shape the CLI and MCP server show — both
verdicts, the `representable` / `pending` / `valid` flags, the installments and blockers,
and rendered messages for findings and absence assumptions.

`evaluateStatement` classifies one statement at a time. To collapse a whole multi-statement
program into a **single** schedule and read its program-level fidelity verdict, use
`evaluateProgramWithRecovery(program, ctx)` — the default, which also recovers an `events-only`
program into a template when its projection has one — or `evaluateProgram(program, ctx)` for the
raw classifier verdict. The engine itself is reachable as `core`:

```ts
import { core } from "@vestlang/vestlang"; // or: import * as core from "@vestlang/core"
```

Reach for `@vestlang/core` directly when you already hold a resolved, combinator-free
template — e.g. another cap-table tool consuming the interchange — and just need to
compile it down to exact integer installments, skipping the DSL entirely. It ships dual
CJS/ESM (the rest of the toolkit is ESM-only) so even CommonJS consumers can depend on the
compiler. (Core sits on `@vestlang/primitives`, the engine substrate — the bare allocator,
date math, and grid kernel — and bundles it in, so a core consumer pulls in nothing extra.)

### 2. As an MCP server

`apps/mcp-server` exposes the full pipeline as Model Context Protocol tools —
`vestlang_parse`, `vestlang_compile`, `vestlang_evaluate`, `vestlang_evaluate_as_of`,
`vestlang_vested_between`, `vestlang_verify_observations`, `vestlang_lint`,
`vestlang_stringify`, `vestlang_infer_schedule` —
and publishes the grammar/spec/examples as resources. This is the surface for driving
vestlang from an LLM agent.

## Examples

All grants below use a grant date of **2025-01-01**. Outputs are produced by the engine.

### Time-based vesting with a cliff → `template`

`VEST OVER 4 years EVERY 1 month CLIFF 1 year` over 4,800 shares:

| Amount | Date | State |
|---:|:---|:---|
| 1,200 | 2026-01-01 | RESOLVED *(cliff lump)* |
| 100 | 2026-02-01 | RESOLVED |
| … | … *(34 more)* | … |
| 100 | 2029-01-01 | RESOLVED |

37 installments, telescoping to exactly 4,800.

### Event-gated cliff → a pending `template` until the IPO fires

`VEST OVER 4 years EVERY 1 month CLIFF LATER OF (+12 months, EVENT ipo)` over 4,800 shares.
The cliff is the *later* of 12 months and the IPO. (Both verdicts are `template`: an
event-held cliff stores as a time `cliff` plus the gate in `event_condition`, so it has a
storable form — it's just held pending until the event arrives.)

**IPO fired on 2026-06-15** → the cliff lands there; everything before it lumps:

| Amount | Date | State |
|---:|:---|:---|
| 1,700 | 2026-06-15 | RESOLVED *(cliff lump)* |
| 100 | 2026-07-01 | RESOLVED |
| … | … | … |

**IPO not yet fired** → `pending: true`, every installment emitted symbolically. The
+12-month floor is a *lower bound* the IPO can only push later, so it binds at realization —
but the pending symbolic dates currently sit at their raw grid positions, not lifted to that
floor (what they should show is an open question, [#447](https://github.com/MattCantor/vestlang/issues/447)):

| Amount | Symbolic date | State | Unresolved |
|---:|:---|:---|:---|
| 100 | `{ UNRESOLVED_CLIFF, 2025-02-01 }` | UNRESOLVED | `EVENT ipo` |
| 100 | `{ UNRESOLVED_CLIFF, 2025-03-01 }` | UNRESOLVED | `EVENT ipo` |
| … | … | … | … |

…with a blocker: `{ type: "EVENT_NOT_YET_OCCURRED", event: "ipo" }`. Supply the event —
`events: { ipo: "2026-06-15" }` (or set `asOf` to model a scenario) — and the same schedule
resolves to the table above. That "schedule known, runtime not yet" span is the default
state of equity, and the DSL owns all of it.

### Graded, multi-statement → one `template`

A 5 / 15 / 40 / 40 graded schedule, written as four statements, collapses to a single
template (no fan-out) — `vest evaluate`, 100 shares:

| Amount | Date | State |
|---:|:---|:---|
| 5 | 2026-01-01 | RESOLVED |
| 15 | 2027-01-01 | RESOLVED |
| 40 | 2028-01-01 | RESOLVED |
| 40 | 2029-01-01 | RESOLVED |

Both verdicts `template`.

### Two overlapping absolute starts → recovered to `template`

Two independent absolute-date grids classify `events-only` on structure alone — but their
realized projection can still have a single-template form, and the default program evaluation
recovers it. `0.5 VEST FROM DATE 2025-01-01 OVER 12 months EVERY 12 months PLUS 0.5 VEST FROM DATE 2025-07-01 OVER 12 months EVERY 12 months` over 100 shares — `vest evaluate`:

| Amount | Date | State |
|---:|:---|:---|
| 50 | 2026-01-01 | RESOLVED |
| 50 | 2026-07-01 | RESOLVED |

Both verdicts `template` — **recovered** from `events-only`, because the two grids are really
one 6-month cadence: `100 VEST FROM DATE 2025-07-01 OVER 12 months EVERY 6 months`. The raw
classifier (`evaluateProgram`) still reports `events-only`; recovery is a property of the
default program surfaces and only fires when the inferred template reproduces the projection
exactly.

### Genuinely `events-only` (no recovery)

When the grids interleave into a stream with no single-template form, recovery correctly
declines and the verdict stays `events-only`. Two monthly grids on different days of the
month — the 1st and the 15th — `0.5 VEST FROM DATE 2024-01-01 OVER 4 months EVERY 1 month PLUS 0.5 VEST FROM DATE 2024-01-15 OVER 4 months EVERY 1 month`:

| Amount | Date | State |
|---:|:---|:---|
| 100 | 2024-02-01 | RESOLVED |
| 100 | 2024-02-15 | RESOLVED |
| … | … *(6 more, alternating)* | … |

Both verdicts `events-only` — *"Two independent absolute-date vesting grids on one grant."*
(More than one distinct start origin on a grant is the other genuine `events-only` case.
An event-anchored cliff, `CLIFF EVENT ipo`, is *not* one — it now stores and resolves as a
`template`, the event hold riding in the cliff's `event_condition`.)

### The inverse: tranches → DSL

`inferSchedule` reconstructs a best-fit vestlang program from an observed array of
`{ date, amount }` tranches by **analytic hypothesize-and-verify**: candidate
templates are derived in closed form from the stream's date lattice and cumulative
sums — a plain uniform train, a cliff, a pre-grant fold, a per-segment-cadence
`THEN` chain, or a single dated lump — and each is verified by evaluating it back
through the real engine and checking it reproduces the input exactly. The first
verifying candidate in a fixed preference order wins. When no single schedule fits,
a bounded **PLUS-cover** search runs before the fallback: it peels a dominant
uniform train off the stream, re-reads the remainder with the same families, and
emits the layers as one `PLUS` program when the assembled result reproduces the
input exactly (at most three statements, always fewer than one per date). Anything
still unrecognized becomes a literal per-date list (projection-lossless by
construction). It returns the `dsl`, a tagged `decomposition` (one component per
statement, labelled by the family that recovered it), and diagnostics (residual
error, detected day-of-month convention, and a `recoveryMode` naming the emission
shape: `single-schedule`, `then-chain`, `plus-cover`, or `literal`).

It recovers more than parallel components. When the tranches read as **one schedule
whose rate or cadence changes over time** — back-to-back segments on a continuing grid,
each picking up where the last left off — the inferrer emits a single `THEN` chain
rather than a stack of independent dated grids. So a stream like `100, 100, 200, 200, 100, 100`
(a monthly rate that doubles for two months, then returns) comes back as one schedule
that classifies as `template`, not as overlapping grids stuck at `events-only`. The chain
form also leaves the month-end handoffs to the engine, so a rate change that lands on a
short month (the 31st springing back to Feb 28/29) still stitches into one template.

This inverse is the engine behind **template recovery** above: when an `events-only` program
projects a stream the inferrer can re-cover as one template, the default program surfaces feed
the projection back through `inferSchedule` and re-classify the result.
